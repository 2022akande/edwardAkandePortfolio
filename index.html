            Hello, my name is Edward Akande and I am a Junior Web Developer.<br>
            I started programming around the age of 11, I would develop web<br>
            pages comprised exclusively of HTML. As I progressed I learned to<br>
            incorporate powerful technologies like React and Bootstrap. My most<br>
            recent work includes personal projects and a few commissioned<br>
            sites all of which can be found under the work section. My philosophy<br>
            when it comes to web development can be summarized by the phrase "why not"<br>
            I want to be a part of the wave of web developers who are pushing the<br>
            envelope and erasing the limitations of what a website can be. It<br>
            always brings me joy to see the full feature in-browser experiences like<br>
            Kapwing and Pixlr. Those developers say why not to extensive photo<br>
            editing right in the browser, They say why not to editing entire videos<br>
            from a website. I believe we will see a day where the only question<br>
            standing between us and the web design projects of the future is simply: why not?<br>

        <h1>Time for some question and answer</h1>
        <h3><span style="color: #6D22DE">Q</span>: Do you read any industry websites or blogs?</h3>
        <p>A: Yes of course, just to name a few:</p>
          <ul style="list-style-type:none;">
            <li><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/">blog.codinghorror.com</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://scotch.io/">scotch.io</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">smashingmagazine.com</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/">freecodecamp.com/news</a></li>
          </ul>
        <h3><span style="color: #6D22DE">Q</span>: Do you prefer to work alone or on a team?</h3>
        <p>A: A team. There are many pros to working on a team the most obvious being a lighter workload.<br>
          In addition to less work, you're also exposed to other peoples code, meaning you might pick up some <br>
          of their good habits. Every developer out there has something to teach me whether they've been coding<br>
          8 years or 8 months.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3><span style="color: #6D22DE">Q</span>: What web browser do you use?</h3>
        <p>A: All of them. As a web developer, I have to see how my code interacts with any web browser<br>
          a user might find themselves on.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3><span style="color: #6D22DE">Q</span>: What is your favorite programing language?</h3>
        <p>A: Don't have one. I haven't learned all of them yet so how could I possibly know which one I like<br>
          the most? Don't worry I'll keep you posted. As for the ones I know now python has certainly proved to be<br>
          more versatile than I expected.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h3><span style="color: #6D22DE">Q</span> Which websites do you find annoying or flawed</h3>
        <P>A: Don't even get me started with Netflix, who told them I wanted to hear a deafening clip of every movie<br>
          I pass over on my way to what I want to watch? In my opinion, any noise that occurs outside of a<br>
          media player is unnecessary.
        </P>
        <br>
        <h3><span style="color: #6D22DE">Q</span>: What if I wanted to ask you a question and you didnt predict it and answer it above?</h3>
        <p>A: Simply visit the links below where you should be able to reach me in some form or fashion.</p>
